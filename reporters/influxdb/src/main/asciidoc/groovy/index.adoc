= InfluxDb Metrics

This project is an implementation of the Vert.x Metrics Service Provider Interface (SPI): metrics built from Vert.x
events will be sent to InfluxDb, an https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb[open source time series database].

== Features

* Vert.x core tools monitoring: TCP/HTTP client and servers, `link:../../apidocs/io/vertx/core/datagram/DatagramSocket.html[DatagramSocket]`,
`link:../../apidocs/io/vertx/core/eventbus/EventBus.html[EventBus]` and handlers
* User defined metrics via an `link:../../apidocs/io/vertx/core/eventbus/EventBus.html[EventBus]` bridge.

== Prerequisites

Follow the https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.2/introduction/getting_started/[instructions to get InfluxDb up and running].

NOTE: You can use a standalone InfluxDb server as well.

== Getting started

The _vertx-monitoring-influxdb_ module must be present in the classpath.

Maven users should add this to their project POM file:

[source,xml,subs="+attributes"]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.vertx</groupId>
  <artifactId>vertx-monitoring-influxdb</artifactId>
  <version>3.5.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
----

And Gradle users, to their build file:

[source,groovy,subs="+attributes"]
----
compile 'io.vertx:vertx-monitoring-influxdb:3.5.1-SNAPSHOT'
----

Please refer to `link:../../apidocs/io/vertx/ext/monitoring/influxdb/VertxInfluxDbOptions.html[VertxInfluxDbOptions]` for an exhaustive list of options.

== Vert.x pool metrics

This section lists all the metrics generated by monitoring Vert.x pools.

There are two types currently supported:

* _worker_ (see `link:../../apidocs/io/vertx/core/WorkerExecutor.html[WorkerExecutor]`)
* _datasource_ (created with Vert.x JDBC client)

NOTE: Vert.x creates two worker pools upfront, _vert.x-worker-thread_ and _vert.x-internal-blocking_.

All metrics are prefixed with `<type>.<name>.`. For example, `worker.vert.x-internal-blocking.`.

== User defined metrics

Users can send their own metrics to the InfluxDb server. In order to do so, the event bus metrics bridge must be
enabled:

[source,groovy]
----
Code not translatable
----

By default, the metrics bus handler is listening to the `influxdb.metrics` address. But the bridge address
can be configured:

[source,groovy]
----
Code not translatable
----

The metrics bridge handler expects messages in the JSON format. The JSON object must at least provide a metric
`id` and a numerical `value`:

[source,groovy]
----
def message = [
  id:"myapp.files.opened",
  value:7
]
vertx.eventBus().publish("influxdb.metrics", message)

----

The handler will assume the metric is a gauge and will assign a timestamp corresponding to the time when the message was processed.
If the metric is a counter or availability, or if you prefer explicit configuration, set the `type` and/or `timestamp` attributes:

[source,groovy]
----
def counterMetric = [
  id:"myapp.files.opened",
  type:"counter",
  timestamp:189898098098908L,
  value:7
]
vertx.eventBus().publish("influxdb.metrics", counterMetric)

def availabilityMetric = [
  id:"myapp.mysubsystem.status",
  type:"availability",
  value:"up"
]
vertx.eventBus().publish("influxdb.metrics", availabilityMetric)

----

NOTE: InfluxDb understands all timestamps as milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC.
